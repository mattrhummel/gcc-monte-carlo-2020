    <h4 class="card-title">Keep students enrolled through Germanna Guarantee Program</h4>
    <p class="card-text">Do you know how many college students frequently have severe financial difficulty with college funding? Even students who receive Pell grants, scholarships and loans to help with the cost of education still have fees that they struggle to pay while studying. More often than not, the gap in fees that the student owes is $500 or less, but even this amount can result in being dropped from enrollment.</p>

  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Money goes to help fund Germanna Guarantee Program</h5>
    <p class="card-text">This special funding for students who struggle with a gap in grants, scholarships and loans pays what’s left so they can stay in school. This year (Fall 2018 & Spring 2019), 292 students were provided Germanna Guarantee funds in the amount of $308,000 thanks to generous donors  to our Scholarship Monte Carlo Event. These are students who otherwise may not have had the opportunity to continue their education.</p>

<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Your generous sponsorship helps fund the Germanna Scholars program</h5>
    <p class="card-text">This program provides dual enrollment scholarships for Culpeper County high school students. They graduate from Germanna at the same time they graduate from high school, and then move on to four-year universities as juniors, saving thousands of dollars in higher education tuition and helping them to avoid a lifetime of student debt.</p>

  <div class="card-body">
<h4  class="card-title">The 1-2-7 Rule</h4>
<p class="card-text">Here’s another interesting fact that shows how your sponsorship impacts students and our wider community: The 1-2-7 Rule asserts that for every 1 position that requires an advanced degree, there are 2 positions where a 4-year degree is needed and 7 positions where credentials less than a 4-year degree are needed. Germanna Community College strives to address the massive skills gap that exists in our labor markets. Your sponsorship of Scholarship Monte Carlo makes a huge difference in thousands of lives!</p>

  <h2>Special Thanks</h2>
  
  <p class="lead mb-0">Our thanks to longtime Germanna supporter Joe Daniel, who will be matching first-time donations to the Germanna Guarantee program up to $5,000 each. Even a small donation will have twice the impact in helping a Germanna student continue his or her education. Your support will mean that deserving Germanna students will not be turned away due to lack of funds.</p>
